# Introduction {-}

This report presents an initial data-driven analysis for WFoundation,  focused on improving global educational access. In preparation for the Board’s strategic planning meeting, our team analysed international education data aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (Quality Education), drawing on additional indicators from SDG 1 (Poverty) and SDG 5 (Gender Equality). Using officially reported UN SDG datasets, we examine global patterns in educational access, identify regions where children are most at risk of being left behind, and explore disparities linked to poverty, gender, and other demographic factors.
Our analysis combines exploratory data visualisation, cross-country comparisons, and trend evaluation using the most recent available data for each nation. Particular attention is given to continental and subregional inequalities, temporal progress, and structural barriers affecting completion rates. The findings lay the groundwork for evidence-based recommendations and highlight priorities for deeper stage-two analysis.
