# Methodology and Data {-}

In this analysis, box plots provided a comprehensive overview of data distributions for SDG 1 and SDG 5 relative to SDG 4, yielding valuable insights into poverty and gender inequalities. For analytical clarity, poverty and marriage rates were categorised into three primary levels, allowing for an examination of patterns across these variables alongside education completion rates. In addition, @cont provided external country codes to further develop the report, by translating Country codes to the country's respective proper name, continent, and sub-region within the continent.

Moreover, mean values were calculated by education level. A threshold equal to the mean was set for enhanced spatial analysis visualisation, with only data below it highlighted. The worst completion rates and their corresponding countries were closely examined, followed by an analysis of continental trends over the years, in which the mean completion rate for each continent was computed and visualised.

Both the median and the mean values were instrumental in addressing disparities in educational attainment rates. This was effectively illustrated through bar and box plots depicting completion rates at various wealth levels across educational strata, and through a table showcasing completion rates by location and education level. Series descriptions were applied to filter out disparities for more precise analysis, while the facet_grid() function enhanced visualisation by educational level, proving practical for analysing access to education. Dashed lines were added to plots to clearly demarcate thresholds.

For comparison, the units were standardised to percentages or ratios, ensuring uniform evaluation across data points. The mean was calculated from summarised questions to support the conclusions. To enhance interpretation, geographic area codes were integrated into the country data, aiding in both plots and analysis deliverables.
The RStudio platform was utilised for model implementation, with essential packages, including tidyverse, rio, dplyr, knitr, kableExtra, and readxl, imported as needed. To streamline the analysis, filtering functions were employed to eliminate unnecessary data and focus on relevant records. The ggplot() function produced visual representations, while the Kable() function generated tables to summarise key findings.
