# Conclusion {-}

This report has shown that progress toward SDG4 remains highly uneven, shaped by regional disparities, structural constraints, and wider social conditions. Spatial analysis highlighted Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Oceania as the weakest performers, while temporal trends revealed a slowing of progress after 2017, particularly in completion and teacher qualification rates. Disparity analysis demonstrated widening wealth, gender and rural–urban gaps at higher education levels, and the cross-SDG investigation confirmed that poverty and early marriage continue to suppress educational outcomes.
These findings suggest that the WFoundation should prioritise strengthening upper secondary progression, improving teacher workforce stability, and expanding access for disadvantaged groups. A further phase of analysis should examine country-level variation and integrate additional SDG4 indicators—such as literacy and numeracy skills (4.6.1) and access to essential school services (4.a.1)—to better understand barriers to learning quality. Incorporating forecasting methods would also help assess whether current trajectories align with SDG4 targets.
Overall, the report provides a coherent evidence base to guide targeted, resilient and long-term interventions in global education.
