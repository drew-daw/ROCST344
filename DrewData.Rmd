# Data {-}

Through the data @dataset provided, the report was generated by looking through the SDG goals pertaining to the issues at hand, in particular SDG goals number four, five, and one. This was filtered by indicators 4.1 through  4.5. These indicators are further analysed within the report, but the data that coincide with them represents each countries reported proportion, rate, or parity ratio -- with each unit dependant on the SDG goal. 

In order to conduct analysis for the organisation's targets, data cleaning was required. This was done via R, a statistical coding language, to not only change the format of the data from a Microsoft Excel document to something more analysable within R, but also to select variables which were needed. Through the use of the `dplyr` package through the `tidyverse` suite, the data was cleaned by selecting the variables deemed needed for analysis, and transforming such variables into their appropriate classes.
