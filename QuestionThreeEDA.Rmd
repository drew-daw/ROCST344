Comparing this with the two sexes also shows different patterns. 

```{r lookSex}
#filter data
DataProSex <- Data %>% filter(Indicator == "4.1.1", Units == "PERCENT", Sex != "BOTHSEX", `sub-region` != "NA")

#plot filtered data
DataProSex %>% ggplot(aes(`sub-region`, Value))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_grid(Sex~`Education level`)+
  gghighlight(quantile(Value,0.5)<75, calculate_per_facet = T)+
  tiltXText
```

Now, what is most concerning is when looking at Latin America and the Caribbean and Northern Africa. Both of these sub-regions in both plots demonstrate a general pattern that the percentage of the entire population -- or just about -- has not achieved 75% proficiency.
