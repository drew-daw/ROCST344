# Conclusion {-}

The findings across all sections indicate that the WFoundation should prioritise strengthening upper secondary progression, improving teacher workforce stability, and expanding access for disadvantaged groups across wealth, gender and rural–urban divides. A second phase of analysis should incorporate additional SDG4 indicators—such as literacy and numeracy skills (4.6.1) and basic school services (4.a.1)—and explore country-level variation to better diagnose barriers to learning quality. Forecasting methods could further assess whether current trajectories align with SDG4 targets, requiring well-developed computational resources and around 30–40 hours of analysing. Together, these steps will support more targeted and resilient long-term intervention planning.
